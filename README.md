# STRESS-docker
# STRESS Docker image

This repository contains the code necessary to build a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image from which to use [STRESS](https://github.com/gersteinlab/STRESS), a framework for identifying potential allosteric residues. This framework requires specific versions of Python 2, numpy, [ScientificPython](https://github.com/khinsen/ScientificPython) and [MMTK](https://github.com/khinsen/MMTK) (Molecular Modelling Toolkit).
